# Part 3: Pilot Strategy and Stakeholder Engagement Plan

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the pilot strategy and stakeholder engagement plan for deploying the AI-Driven Phishing and SMS Threat Detection System within the Tanzanian electoral ecosystem. The goal is to ensure a successful, measurable, and sustainable adoption of the solution, starting with the National Electoral Commission (NEC) as the primary stakeholder.

## 2. Pilot Scope and Partner Organization
**Pilot Partner:** National Electoral Commission (NEC), Tanzania

**Scope:**
- Deploy the phishing detection system within NEC’s IT and communications infrastructure.
- Integrate with NEC’s SMS/email gateway to monitor all election-related messages.
- Provide real-time alerts and analytics to NEC security and IT staff.
- Run the pilot during a real election cycle or a simulated campaign period.

**Rationale:**
NEC is responsible for managing voter communication and is a high-value target for phishing and misinformation attacks. Piloting the solution with NEC will maximize impact and provide valuable feedback for further refinement.

## 3. Adoption Roadmap
### **A. Infrastructure Setup**
- Deploy the Flask-based app on NEC’s secure cloud or on-premises server.
- Ensure all dependencies and the trained model are installed.
- Set up secure access (authentication, HTTPS) for the dashboard.

### **B. Data Flows**
- Integrate the app with NEC’s SMS/email gateway for real-time message ingestion.
- Store all analyzed messages and alerts in a secure database or log file for auditability.

### **C. Training and Onboarding**
- Conduct training sessions for NEC IT and security staff on:
  - Using the dashboard
  - Interpreting phishing alerts
  - Responding to incidents
- Provide user manuals and quick-start guides.

### **D. Testing and Feedback**
- Run the pilot during a live election period or a simulated campaign.
- Collect feedback from users on usability, accuracy, and incident response.
- Refine the system based on feedback and observed performance.

## 4. Rollout Plan
1. **Preparation:**
   - Finalize deployment environment (cloud/on-premises)
   - Test integration with SMS/email gateway
   - Prepare training materials
2. **Deployment:**
   - Install and configure the app
   - Set up user accounts and access controls
3. **Training:**
   - Conduct hands-on training for all relevant staff
4. **Pilot Launch:**
   - Begin monitoring messages during the election period
   - Respond to phishing alerts in real time
5. **Monitoring and Evaluation:**
   - Track KPIs and collect user feedback
   - Hold review meetings to discuss incidents and improvements
6. **Scale-Up:**
   - Based on pilot success, expand deployment to other stakeholders (e.g., TCRA, telcos, political parties)

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Detection Rate:** Percentage of phishing messages correctly flagged by the system
- **False Positive Rate:** Percentage of legitimate messages incorrectly flagged
- **Time to Detection:** Average time from message receipt to alert generation
- **User Adoption:** Number of NEC staff actively using the dashboard
- **Incident Response:** Number of phishing incidents detected and resolved
- **Training Completion:** Percentage of staff trained on the system

---

## 6. Stakeholder Engagement Plan
- **Initial Engagement:** Present the solution and pilot plan to NEC leadership and IT/security teams.
- **Ongoing Communication:** Hold regular check-ins with NEC stakeholders to address concerns and gather feedback.
- **Collaboration:** Work with NEC’s IT department to ensure smooth integration and address technical challenges.
- **Feedback Loop:** Implement a structured process for collecting and acting on user feedback during the pilot.
- **Reporting:** Provide regular reports on system performance, incidents detected, and recommendations for improvement.

## 7. Conclusion
This pilot strategy provides a clear, actionable roadmap for deploying and evaluating the AI-driven phishing detection system within NEC. By focusing on real-world integration, staff training, and measurable KPIs, the pilot will demonstrate the system’s value and lay the groundwork for broader adoption across Tanzania’s electoral ecosystem.
